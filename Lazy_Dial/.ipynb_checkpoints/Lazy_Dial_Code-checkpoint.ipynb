    "\n",
    "##### Algorithm 1\n",
    "A basic way to approach this problem is to be locally greedy and choose the finger resulting into a minimum distance for the next digit, based upon the current position of left and right fingers. For e.g. given we start at (\\*, #) and the next digit to press is **1**, the distance of pressing it with left finger is **3** units, whereas for right finger it is **3.6**. Therfore, the locally greedy approach says we use the left finger to press this digit. After that, we continue in similar fashion for rest of the digits  \n",
    "**Time Complexity**: O(n)\n",
    "**Space Complexity**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the above approach results into a higher total distance in cases where you can strategically choose a high distance finger for one digit and still end up with an overall lower total distance traversed. For e.g. If we are dialling **\"583\"**  \n",
    "**Output based on algorithm 1**: (5.47, \\[('\\*','#'),('5','#'),('8','#'),('3','#')\\]) \n",

    "**Output based on overall cost minimization**: (5.06, \\[('\\*','#'),('5','#'),('5','8'),('3','8')\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem statement, we need to compute the smallest amount of total distance. Therefore, I have to design an algorithm to return **output 2** instead of **output 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Algorithm 2\n",
    "An easiest way to minimize overall cost is to programatically generate all possible paths, compute the overall distance for each path, and choose the one with minimum distance. As there are two possible choices (left or right finger to dial) at every digit on the telephone number, the time complexity for this algorithm would be **O(n.2<sup>n</sup>)**  \n",
